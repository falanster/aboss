## Summary
This package is a means of working with data in one or more grids in PHP.  You can think of this as a lean spreadsheet with rows and columns, and optionally, pages.

It allows a single data class `ExportData` to be used to organize your data in a grid, with various output styles `Exporter` so you can easily get a `.csv` file or a `.xlsx` file, among others.

See the code for more documentation.
